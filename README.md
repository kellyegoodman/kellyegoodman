### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kelly, a software developer that mostly works on application software in C++. Occasionally I like to experiment in areas completely different from my usual work, such as mobile app development and backend web development. I use my github mainly for hosting these hobby projects or for saving tutorials I've completed for future reference.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to learn Go and how to develop backend applications.

- :sparkles: One project I am particularly proud of is called [WhatToWear](https://github.com/kellyegoodman/WhatToWear). It is an android app that can help you answer the question: What should I wear today? :womans_clothes::necktie:.
